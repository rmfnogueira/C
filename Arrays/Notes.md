# Arrays

- Arrays are an important construct of any programming language. To keep data of a similar type together, we need arrays. Arrays are heavily used in applications where elements have to be accessed at random. Arrays are also a prime choice when you need to sort elements, look for desired data in a collection, and find common or unique data between two sets.

- Arrays are assigned contiguous memory locations and are a very popular structure for sorting and searching data collections because any element of an array can be 
accessed by simply specifying its subscript or index location.
